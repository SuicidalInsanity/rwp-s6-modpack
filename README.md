# RWP Season 6 Modpack

Hullo, it's EclipticIndustries here! Welcome to the [Runway Project Season 6](https://discord.gg/mzAbqvmP) modpack. This modpack is meant to be used in the context of RWP S6, but feel free to check it out regardless if you're looking for a somewhat tailored aircraft-focused BDArmory experience, with a stock KSP balance.

We've chosen to distribute this modpack as a stand-alone zip file rather than a CKAN archive mostly for simplicity, but also to allow us to be selective in which parts are in included, and to easily integrate customized config. If you're interested in using this modpack as a player, just download `RWP_Modpack.zip`, and copy the `GameData` folder within it into your KSP install.

If you want to build on the modpack, or use it as a developer, you'll instead need to clone this git repository (*along with all its submodules!*) with `git checkout --recurse-submodules git@github.com/ecliptic-industries/rwp-s6-modpack`. In order to rebuild the mod, first install Node.js, then run `npm install` from the root of the repo to pull down some dependencies. You can then issue a rebuild command by running `npm run build`.

If you want to work with the Blender or Substance Painter source files for any of our custom parts, you'll also need to install and set up [Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage). All the custom content is stored in `src/parts`.
